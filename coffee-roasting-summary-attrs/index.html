        summary="Coffee roasting transforms green coffee beans into roasted coffee products by causing chemical and physical changes. The process involves sorting, roasting, cooling, and packaging, with various methods and used depending on the scale and desired quality. Home roasting, which was once common, has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the ability to achieve finer control over the quality and characteristics of the finished product. Roasting can be done using different techniques, such as drum or hot-air roasting, and can result in a range of flavors and aromas depending on the level of roast. The level of roast is determined by factors like temperature, color, and sound, with lighter roasts retaining more of the coffee's origin character and darker roasts exhibiting more dominant roast flavors.">
