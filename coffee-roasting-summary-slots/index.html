        <span slot="heading">A summary of coffee roasting</span>
        <span slot="summary">Coffee roasting transforms green coffee beans into roasted coffee products by causing
            chemical and physical
            changes. The process involves sorting, roasting, cooling, and packaging, with various methods and equipment
            used
            depending on the scale and desired quality. Home roasting, which was once common, has seen a resurgence in
            popularity due to the ability to achieve finer control over the quality and characteristics of the finished
            product. Roasting can be done using different techniques, such as drum or hot-air roasting, and can result
            in a
            range of flavors and aromas depending on the level of roast. The level of roast is determined by factors
            like
            temperature, color, and sound, with lighter roasts retaining more of the coffee's origin character and
            darker
            roasts exhibiting more dominant roast flavors.</span>
